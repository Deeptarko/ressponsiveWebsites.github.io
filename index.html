        Training is teaching, or developing in oneself or others, any skills and knowledge or fitness that relate to
        specific useful competencies. Training has specific goals of improving one's capability, capacity, productivity
        and performance. It forms the core of apprenticeships and provides the backbone of content at institutes of
        technology (also known as technical colleges or polytechnics). In addition to the basic training required for a
        trade, occupation or profession, training may continue beyond initial competence to maintain, upgrade and update
        skills throughout working life. People within some professions and occupations may refer to this sort of
        training as professional development. Training also refers to the development of physical fitness related to a
        specific competence, such as sport, martial arts, military applications and some other occupations.

        Education in India is primarily provided by public schools (controlled and funded by the government at three
        levels: central, state and local) and private schools. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution, free
        and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of
        public schools to private schools in India is 7:5.India has made progress in increasing the attainment rate of
        primary education. In 2011, Approximately 75% of the population, aged between 7 and 10 years, was literate.[5]
        India's improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development.[6]
        Much of the progress, especially in higher education and scientific research, has been credited to various
        public institutions.

        Transforming education in India

      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
        Starting in about 3500 B.C., various writing systems developed in ancient civilizations around the world. In
        Egypt fully developed hieroglyphs were in use at Abydos as early as 3400 B.C.[1] The oldest known alphabet was
        developed in central Egypt around 2000 B.C. from a hieroglyphic prototype. One hieroglyphic script was used on
        stone monuments,[2] other cursive scripts were used for writing in ink on papyrus,[2] a flexible, paper-like
        material, made from the stems of reeds that grow in marshes and beside rivers such as the River Nile.

        The Phoenician writing system was adapted from the Proto-Canaanite script in around the 11th century BC, which
        in turn borrowed ideas from Egyptian hieroglyphics. This script was adapted by the Greeks. A variant of the
        early Greek alphabet gave rise to the Etruscan alphabet, and its own descendants, such as the Latin alphabet.
        Other descendants from the Greek alphabet include the Cyrillic script, used to write Russian, among others.

        The Phoenician system was also adapted into the Aramaic script, from which the Hebrew script and also that of
        Arabic are descended.
